## Data Attributes

A dataset containing these attributes powers the Service Connect app.  While several fields are optional, they greatly improve the user experience for both citizen users and administrators.  

An example can be found [here](https://scs.demo.socrata.com/Government/NOLA-311-App-Data/kdi4-pasu).

* `Open` and `Closed` in proper case are the only valid entries for the `ticket_status` column.  

## Optional Category Mapping

Sometimes issue categories don't have citizen-friendly names.  If a publisher wishes to present a given issue category with a friendlier name, they can optionally populate a dataset, with the fields below, and the app will display alternative names within the user interface.  

An example can be found [here](https://scs.demo.socrata.com/Government/NOLA-311-Category-Names/n4pj-tfiu).  

| Attribute                       | API Field                | Type       | Required | Role within app                                                   |
| ---                             | ---                      | ---        | ---      | ---                                                               |
| Source Name                     | `source_name`            | Plain Text | No       | Identifies name within source dataset                             |
| Category Display Name           | `display_name`           | Plain Text | No       | Alternative citizen-facing category name                          |
| Secondary Category Display Name | `secondary_display_name` | Plain Text | No       | Alternative citizen-facing category name for secondary categories |

## Neighborhood / District Geospatial Data

The Service Connect App requires a Shapefile that corresponds to the `neighborhood_district` field.
